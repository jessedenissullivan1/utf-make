## UTF - Make ##

Example of a sample project that has unit tests that build separately from the main app.  The makefile in the tst directory allows for instrumentation of source under test.  To make the sample app, type `make` in the root directory.  To make the unit tests type `make` in the `tst`Â directory.  Consult makefiles for app names.
